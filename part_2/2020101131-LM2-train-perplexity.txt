the count of monte cristo had just entered .: 15.085243225097656

no one can say that m. unk did not love his child , and yet he sleeps .: 42.634178161621094
this double error became an irresistible reality , and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth , he bounded from his hiding place , and with two strides , at the risk of being seen , at the risk of alarming valentine , at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl , he crossed the flower garden , which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake , and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house , he reached the step , ran quickly up and pushed the door , which opened without offering any resistance .: 71.06765747070312

why all these precautions ?: 83.72869873046875
aramis cast a glance upon d unk to see what effect all this produced , and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws .: 89.003662109375
but parry withdrew , thinking he was dreaming .: 166.7543487548828
ali appeared .: 446.2203674316406

the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu .: 67.88531494140625
the truth was , that the mention of two places in the palazzo unk had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the unk , in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina , then he should be able to establish his identity , and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom .: 87.69727325439453
