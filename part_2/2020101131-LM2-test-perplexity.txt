as he spoke , villefort drew the letter from his pocket , and presented it to dante s. dante s read it .: 30.878494262695312

and i idem , said aramis .: 123.45897674560547
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations , for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left , in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side , while it left me unharmed .: 233.86865234375

porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine .: 100.34549713134766
it will be one valiant sword the less , but there will remain still three , without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies , to be at his side in battle , to aid him with counsel , to escort him in flight , are sufficient , not to make the king a conqueror , but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say , once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and unk as the unk finds in a storm .: 192.6427764892578
